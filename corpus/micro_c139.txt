I do not believe that government regulation would make a difference. Funding an industry does not guarantee success. If the industry is self sustainable and profitable, they would eventually be able to stand on their own. If not, than the government is putting money into keeping something alive that is not a viable option otherwise. In conclusion, government aid would not be a factor in the wind industry spreading faster.
