Helicopter parents can cause children to grow up to be overly dependent. While watchful parents keep their children out of harms way, they also make it difficult for their child to become independent and make their own decisions. Children should be able to make some small decisions for themselves at a young age; this way, they can continue to make bigger decisions as they grow into teens and young adults. HELICOPTER PARENTS ARE BAD FOR THEIR CHILDREN.
