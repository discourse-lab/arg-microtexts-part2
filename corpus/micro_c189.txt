Video games do not necessarily have a bad impact on family life as long as they are played within a reasonable time limit and if all members can enjoy the games together. If video games consume a good part of the day and are not enjoyed by all then yes, they could have an impact in that there will be no actual social interaction of those in the family unit. If the entire family participates in the game then they are all enjoying themselves together and bonding. Thus there is no bad impact. It is just like people playing board games. Monopoly can take many hours to play and there is no bad impact on family life because all are playing together.
