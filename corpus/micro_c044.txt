I believe that recycling does indeed make a big difference. When we recycle we are making less trash that winds up in our landfills. There are many benefits to recycling, one being we are using less energy by recycling then we use by producing new items. It also makes people feel like they are really making an impact on the environment by doing something that is very easy and doesn't take much time to do. I really don't see any downside to recycling. One should always try to reuse, reduce and recycle anything that they can.
