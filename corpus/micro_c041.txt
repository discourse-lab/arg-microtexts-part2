The expectations of real relationships based on what people see in movies is way over dramatized. If people think that their life should turn out like a movie and then find out it is way different they should not be shocked. We have everyday responsibilities that you don't see in movies. We have mundane and boring moments and lots of them. I have a hard time believing too that in real life people that we would tend to be attracted to would even be closely comparable to a character in a movie. YES, THE EXPECTATIONS RAISED BY ROMANTIC MOVIES ARE DAMAGING TO REAL RELATIONSHIPS.
