I think that supermarkets should charge a small amount for plastic bags. This charge could help people remember and consider the idea of using 'free' reusable bags. But also, the fee for the plastic bags could go towards the cost of recycling the bags. They could add a program for collecting clean used bags. But if the fee was small, it wouldn't be too bad for those who forgot their reusable bags, or have their reasons for using plastic each time.
