Hunting is good for the environment because overpopulated species can be thinned out. Getting rid of an overpopulation enables the smaller animals in the food chain to grow. It also allows for nature to take back the woods and grasslands, which will also enable other wildlife to grow. Some people may object to hunting on the basis of humane treatment of animals. Animals do not necessarily feel pain as we do, and if there are not enough resources to sustain an overpopulation, then a quick bullet or arrow is better than slow starvation.
