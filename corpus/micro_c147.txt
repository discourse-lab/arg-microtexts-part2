Long distance relationships test the strength of any relationship. Each person involved must want the relationship to work for it to actually happen. They would also need to understand that there is going to be a lack of any physical contact for a long period of time. I feel that in humanity there is a need for physical intimacy for anyone so by being so distant you can't make that happen. For this reason I think they usually work at first but however over time they will fail to meet all the criteria of a good relationship.
