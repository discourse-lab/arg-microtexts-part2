LED lights do cost more than traditional incandescent bulbs. But in the long run, they will help save energy. They use 25 to 80 percent less power. They also can last for years, meaning they will not need to be replaced as often. By swapping out all light bulbs in your home or business with LED lights, you should see a noticeable drop in energy consumption.
