Social media has been largely detrimental to teenagers specifically because they are not yet developed enough to handle it. Social media has eliminated many barriers and limited privacy in such a way that has made teens very vulnerable. Social bullying is a rampant issue, and teens are often unable to place reasonable limits on their social media time. It is true that social media is very beneficial for staying in contact with people far away, but because there are no limits teens often wind up spending more time in that virtual world than in the real world.
