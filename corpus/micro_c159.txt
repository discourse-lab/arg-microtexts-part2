Teenage marriages are not a good idea. People in their teens are still developing and figuring out what they want in life. The influence of another can make things seem like that is what they want, but they might be putting off personal desires because of that person. Also, it takes time to work and save enough money to live independently, so getting married may pave the way for kids, but it can be a lot harder to support children when you are young.
