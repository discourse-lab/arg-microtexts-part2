Older people do not necessarily make better parents. While it might be tempting to think that older parents will exercise better judgment in childrearing, it is simply not the case that growing older means growing wiser. Younger parents will likely have levels of physical energy and stamina more closely aligned to their children's. Young mothers are more likely to bear healthy children, which is no small part of being a good parent. Finally, older parents will reach the age at which they need support from their children when their children are relatively young and not yet in the peak earning years.
