One could argue that a supermarket charging for plastic bags would cause them to lose customers who might shop somewhere else that doesn't charge. There is also the environmental concern that plastic bags harm the environment. I believe that proper disposal of plastic bags solves the problem without creating a financial hardship for the retailer. A simple internet search reveals that there are ways to recycle plastic bags if your curbside program doesn't allow them. Public awareness of these programs should be the focus. Lets put the burden on the consumer, not the retailer. SUPERMARKETS SHOULD NOT CHARGE FOR PLASTIC BAGS.
