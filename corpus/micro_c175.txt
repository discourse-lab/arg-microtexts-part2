Helicopter parents, because they are overly protective, tend not to allow their children to develop the ability to effectively cope with adversity on their own. Further, such parents' constant hovering prevents their children from really experiencing independence or fully appreciating the benefits (and perils) of risk taking. There are, of course, real safety concerns from which children need to be protected. However, excessive parental caution is likely to result in children who grow into adults less capable than otherwise in dealing with a complex, sometimes unfriendly, world. HELICOPTER PARENTS ARE BAD FOR THEIR CHILDREN.
