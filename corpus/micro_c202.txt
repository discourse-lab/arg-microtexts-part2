I personally lean towards large families being worse for children than small families. In a larger family resources per child would be more scarce both financially, e.g. college, and parental. Of course this argument is based on the assumption that the topic is about families in developed countries, in developing countries larger families can be a necessity to make sure that any of the children live to adulthood. In a developed country a child needing interaction with other children would have to interact with their non-family peers, thereby learning valuable social skills.
