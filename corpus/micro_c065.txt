Social media has hurt the lives of teenagers in several ways. First it has seemingly kept children from many real life interactions and confined them to the front of a computer screen or cell phone. Also it has redefined the term 'friend' and therefor friendship. More and more people are concerned with how many 'likes' they receive while pulling away from making true and lasting friendships and building life experiences.
