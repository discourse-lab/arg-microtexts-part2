Teenagers have the same parental rights as any biological parent. There should not be an assumption that a teenager is automatically an unfit parent. Unless the state can prove that a teenager is unfit, abusive, or neglectful to the unborn or born child then teenagers have the right to keep their children just as any parent would.
