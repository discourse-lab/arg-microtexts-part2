Large families provide a wonderful life for children, because it usually means they have lots of brothers and sisters to play with. Parents don't live forever, and it can be very comforting to know you will have siblings that can still form a family with you. IF you don't get along as well with one or more siblings, you don't feel isolated because there are undoubtedly other siblings you can interact with. You could argue that children in large families don't receive as much one-on-one attention from their parents. However, many children who go to day care all day or just don't have very active parents have similar experiences, and with a larger family love could come from other sources than just the parents.
