Nuclear energy has been proven time and time again to be safe. It has been proven, over six decades, to have a minimal impact on the environment, as they emit almost no greenhouse gases. The chances of anything untoward happening to a nuclear facility are also slim. There have been a few nuclear events since Chernobyl, but there have been relatively few fatalities associated with it.
