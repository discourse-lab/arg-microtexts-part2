Using a cell phone while driving is extremely dangerous. Any time a driver is focused on a handheld device, they are not paying attention to the road. This can lead to accidents, which can cause serious injury and even death. Some people might argue that they could miss an important call while driving, but it is far better to pull to the side of the road and take the call rather than to keep driving. Prohibiting car drivers from using their cell phones while driving would go a long way to making our roads safer.
