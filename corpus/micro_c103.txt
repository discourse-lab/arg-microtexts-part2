I don't believe that paper and books will ever become obsolete. People enjoy having something tangible to read and/or write on. Even though people may say that reading ebooks will be the future, there have been studies that show reading on computer screens causes eye strain. There is also the security of knowing that paper and books can not be accidentally or purposefully erased by something such as user error or a virus.
