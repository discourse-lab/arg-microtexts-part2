Helicopter parents are not good for their children because they do not allow their children to learn by making mistakes. When children are unable to make decisions for themselves and learn independence, they cannot function as well as adults. Children need to learn to think on their own and sometimes even get hurt or make mistakes to grow as people. The world is a tough place and children need to learn how to live in this tough world to make it as an adult.
