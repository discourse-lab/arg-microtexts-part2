Divorce is something that kids can recover from. There are many adults who live fully functional lives even though their parents were divorced. It is better for children to be in a loving environment than in one where parents are constantly arguing and fighting with each other. Of course everyone wants to stay together for their children, but many people are better off just co-parenting instead of staying married.
