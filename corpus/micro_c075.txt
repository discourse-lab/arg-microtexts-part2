Violent video games do not cause people to act out violently. There are those that say that violence in video games exposes children to hurting people which could cause them to act those things out in reality. I disagree. In fact, I believe the evidence shows that the opposite is the case. Children, especially young boys who have an outlet for the expression that involves simulated events and not real ones helps them to learn about and work through important themes like violence. If there was not a medium for children to act out these situations in harmless ways they might experiment in reality. This would have even more disastrous consequences than a few hours gaming.
