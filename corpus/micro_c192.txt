People who own dogs should show them respect, but they should not treat them like a family member. To treat a dog the same as a family member is disrespectful to the rest of the family. A dog has no idea what a birthday is or feels the need to wear clothes. While you can have a party for your pet and dress it up in a party outfit, that doesn't make it human, only looks silly, and makes the dog uncomfortable.
