I think it's possible for older people to be better parents. They have had time to mature more and learn about themselves. They're more likely to have steady careers going so they can provide for a child. Some might say being too old risks the child being disabled, but insisting all babies be perfect is demanding the impossible as well as demeaning to people already living who are disabled.
