Wind energy is a viable form of alternative energy production that should be encouraged in use. Government regulation is important for this, as it provides incentives for using wind energy and penalties for relying on other, more polluting forms of energy. The world must reduce its reliance on fossil fuels as a main source of energy, as fossil fuel is finite and it's use causes widespread damage to the environment. Another option of alternate energy, nuclear power, has its own environmental and safety risks that make it non-viable as a main source of power. Wind energy, along with other types of energy such as solar power, is self-renewing, clean, and relatively safe for both people and the surrounding ecosystems.
