It is not normal behavior to treat you dog as an equal to your family. In some ways it is good for the heart to have a fur friend in your home. The supplies for dogs can be somewhat expensive. If a person loses their source of income then their dogs may suffer and not receive adequate care. Treating a dog on par with family members is a very unwise choice because we never know what will happen in the future.
