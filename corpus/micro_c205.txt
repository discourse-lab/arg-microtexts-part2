Large families are not necessarily better for children. Having a larger family causes each member to feel like they have to excel or act out for attention. One could argue that with a larger family, the children would have more people to rely on. However, this could also cause disturbances and jealousy. Smaller families have the potential to be tighter and more close knit due to their size.
