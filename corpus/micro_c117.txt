I would be too worried about my health to move to Beijing. I do not think a high paying job would be worth it if it either messed me up for life or caused my life to end early because of the high rate of pollution. I have not seen or even heard of China working to lower or rid the city of its problem. I might want to move there to be closer to Japan and have a high paying job, but in the end it wouldn't be worth it.
