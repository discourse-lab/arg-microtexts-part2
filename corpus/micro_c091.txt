People are always trying to think of innovative ways to improve schools, adding video games is now one of them. This makes little sense, however. Adding technology of any kind, even computers, hasn't improved national test scores. Some would argue that schools need more money to spend on this kind of creative approach. Spending more money, hasn't improved national test scores though. In the long run, improved test scores and student performance comes from the basics: reading, writing, arithmetic, and especially discipline in the classroom. Learning comes from hard work; there's no way to sugar-coat it with fun video games. Qualified teachers, actually teaching students is what's necessary.
