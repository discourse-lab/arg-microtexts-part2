Older parents may make better parents. They may be more financially secure. They may have more patience and be in a more secure relationship. One problem is they may not be as able to keep up with their kids or not be able to do as much fun stuff with them. But they can provide a more stable home. They will be more able to make sure their kids have everything they need.
