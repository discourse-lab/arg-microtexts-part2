Paper and books will never become completely obsolete. While lots of people have really enjoyed all the technology around being able to read electronically, lots of people will always prefer books. Most of these people are probably older so as the older generation dies, paper books will become more obsolete. However, due to funding I don't think that schools and colleges will ever be able to go fully electronic. So there will always be paper books out there.
