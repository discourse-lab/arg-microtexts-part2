I think that, in most circumstances, teenagers that get pregnant should keep their children. It will generally be better for both parties. Having a child will cause the teenager to have to grow up. The child will be better off staying with its biological parents. If the child and parent become separated, the entire bloodline and family becomes fractured. It is not natural or beneficial for this to happen.
