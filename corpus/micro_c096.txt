Most studies show that LED lights tend to consume less energy for the same amount of light emitted. They are generally considered to be much more efficient than incandescent light bulbs for example. So it seems logical to think that LED lights would indeed make a difference, that is they would decrease, our energy consumption. It might be argued that some people could end up using LED lights more heavily because knowing that they are less expensive to operate, but it's generally understood that people don't necessarily increase their lighting uses easily, it's something that tends to remain stable.
