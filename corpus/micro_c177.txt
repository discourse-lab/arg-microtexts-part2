If you do not have any siblings, you have all the attention of your parents and do not have to share. Furthermore, you don't have any sibling rivalry. You don't have to argue about which TV show to watch. There is no pressure to do better than some one else. Furthermore you do not have to be a role model for them. IT IS GOOD TO BE THE ONLY CHILD.
