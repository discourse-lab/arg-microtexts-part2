Protecting our environment is crucial to combating climate change, one small change is to promote the recycling of soft drink bottles and cans. This is a simple way to reuse plastic and other materials, to decrease the amount of gas that it harvested. By developing a small deposit on these cans you encourage people to pick these cans up along the road thus creating a cleaner environment. It is also a benefit as it encourages people to go to stores to recycle and then spend that money at the shop increasing the amount spent at the store and encouraging economic growth.
