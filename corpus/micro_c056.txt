All states should adopt a deposit on soft drink bottles and cans because it greatly incentives recycling. The five or ten cent deposit is noticeable and serves as a reminder of recycling during checkout. Once you have collected a bag or two full of cans and bottles, returning those cans and bottles is worth $5-$15, a meaningful amount of money for many people and families. Recycling is vital and incentivizing it in this simple way works.
