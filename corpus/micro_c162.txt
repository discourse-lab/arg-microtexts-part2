I firmly believe in the right to choose, but differ in the areas that we have the right to take a life. I feel that anyone, no matter the age, even a teenager should seek other outlets such as adoption, or raising the child, depending on how they got pregnant (such as rape). No child deserves to become pregnant against their will, but one should indeed take responsibility if it is of their own accord. TEENAGERS THAT GET PREGNANT SHOULD KEEP THEIR CHILDREN.
