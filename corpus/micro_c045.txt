Recycling really does make a difference because without it, there would be an abundance of paper, glass, and plastic. If we did not recycle, before long there would be nowhere to put all of the extra garbage. Recycling helps the environment by keeping non-natural things out of it. This way, animals do not accidentally eat it and get sick or die. It also helps keep plastics, which are not biodegradable, out of the environment, and from getting into our water supplies.
