Any family activity has the potential for bonding, sharing, and emulation. Some may think that competitive environment generally associated with sport can be disruptive of family harmony. This is not necessarily the case. Adults have the opportunity to demonstrate sportsmanship and proper behavior to their children. There is ample opportunity for family bonding whether competing as a team or against one other. The documented contribution of sport to physical and mental well-being also argues in favor of family participation. DOING SPORTS TOGETHER IS A GOOD THING FOR FAMILIES.
