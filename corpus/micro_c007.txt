Do older people make better parents? In this day and age the answer can only be yes. Older people are far more mature than this new generation of slackers and hipsters. Older people make far more money than younger people on average, allowing them to take care of the needs and education of children. Older people have far more experience than younger people. Some might say that older people are not physically fit enough to take care of children the way younger people would be, but health is on decline for younger people as well, so that really does not make much of a difference now.
