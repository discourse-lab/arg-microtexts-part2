Teens are inexperienced with life and may have trouble raising a child. However, it is a basic human right that people can have children and raise them. Only severely unsuitable parents should be made to give up their kids. It is a responsibility of government to help children in difficult circumstances. TEENAGERS THAT GET PREGNANT SHOULD KEEP THEIR CHILDREN.
