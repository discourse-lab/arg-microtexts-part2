Car drivers should be prohibited from using cell phones while driving because their full attention should be on the road and any potential hazards. If people talk are holding onto a phone while steering, this limits their ability to control their vehicle. A vehicle can be a lethal weapon if used carelessly. Some may say that just talking in a car while driving is a distraction, even without holding a cell phone; however, anything that helps keep a driver's attention on driving, is a positive. Not allowing driver to talk on their cell phones will prevent many accidents and tragedies.
