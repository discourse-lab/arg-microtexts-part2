Helicopter parenting has proven to be detrimental to the success of children. Over involvement in the work, production, and affairs of children impact the child's ability to face consequences and experiences good and bad decisions. While one can argue that this type of parenting style benefits a child due to the active involvement and guidance by a parent there are few arguments to support. Children need to learn, make their own choices, and live with the consequences of their actions in order to grow and development.
