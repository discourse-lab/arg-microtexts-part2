I believe that older people don't make better parents. While they do have more experience in life and may be able to offer their child more guidance when it comes to difficult decisions that child will have to face, they also are going to have a more difficult time staying active with the child. Children are INCREDIBLY active and it takes a lot of energy to keep up with them. It would seem to me to discourage physical activity if the parents are older, and this is at a time when children as a whole are becoming less physically fit and less active. While I do acknowledge that older parents do have more life knowledge, the inexperience of a young parent can be offset by their parents (the child's grandparents), god parents, and family friends.
