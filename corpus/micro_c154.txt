Divorce can be devastating to children in the family, but it is an event they can recover from. Children are resilient and can often bounce back from traumatic events quicker and more easily than adults. It is often more beneficial to have two parents in the household, however, if the marriage is unhappy, divorce would be better for all members of the family. As long as the kids are provided with a stable home life, divorce does not have to be an enormous trauma from which there is no recovering.
