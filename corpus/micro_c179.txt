Being an only child is not a good thing. Often single children are spoiled and because of this, they think they are entitled to more and better things than others as they grow up. Being an only child can also cause feelings of loneliness and isolation, which are not good for a child's mental health. Being an only child can be boring for a child, so it is also more of a strain on the parents to keep the child busy and to socialize the child.
