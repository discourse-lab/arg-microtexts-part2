For the purposes of treatment and care it is absolutely okay to treat the family pet dog on par with other family members. Dogs need water, food, and medical treatment just like humans. They also need attention and affection just like humans. That doesn't mean, of course, that family members should feel free to eat out of the dogs bowl without expecting a subsequent illness to occur. Common sense dictates that dogs are a different species and some reasonable precautions need to be taken to in certain situations. It is said that dogs are man's best friend. If that is true then they should be treated as such.
