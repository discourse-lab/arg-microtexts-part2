Video games are much more than just having fun and goofing off. Many games can teach people several skills without even realizing it, such as planning ahead, patience and persistence, efficiency, and more. If games were actually tailored to the learning aspect, they could still be seriously fun (and have super cool graphics), but require a skill - like math or grammar - to be learned, to win the game. This ensures something good is being gained from video games in school, and technology is well-utilized.
