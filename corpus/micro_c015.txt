Removing the horns of wild rhinos leaves them defenseless. It takes years for horns to regrow. Some say removing the horns will keep poachers from killing rhinos. Unfortunately, there is little to back up this position. Poachers have been known to kill rhinos out of anger or simple meanness. NO, THE HORN OF RHINOS SHOULD NOT BE REMOVED TO PREVENT THEM FROM BEING POACHED.
