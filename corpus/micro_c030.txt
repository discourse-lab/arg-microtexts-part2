People should date for at least 1 year before they become engaged. It takes at least this long to get to know each other on a level deeper than attraction. They should use this time to learn of each others character and beliefs. Families should get to know them as a couple as well. Christians who believe in waiting till marriage for sex could argue that it is better to marry sooner than to have premarital sex.  This may be true, but it also takes a much larger chance that the couple will actually be compatible in the long run.
