Composting can be very beneficial for our environment. It is a well known fact that we toss out huge amounts of food waste, whether as scraps from meal preparation, or that head of lettuce we forgot in the back of the refrigerator. Composting is the best way to mitigate the loss and turn it into a highly beneficial fertilizer. There is some consideration required to consider the logistics of composting since it takes a good amount space and can, but not always, produce an odor. However, any space required is more than offset by the reduction of material sent to landfills. Composted fertilizers are some of the most environmentally friendly fertilizers and are highly effective in growing healthy plants to start the cycle over again.
