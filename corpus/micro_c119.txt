I don't think that nuclear energy is safe. Just look at Fukushima, do you think that is safe? Humans are incapable because of greed to operate a reactor without cutting corners and incompetence. The pollution is long lasting, as in forever, and harmful to anything living. It is only safe if you listen to government propaganda.
