It is OK to treat dogs on par with family members because they're a part of the family. We look after them as we do our own family. We feed them, bath them, take them to their appointments. We want to make sure they're ok, like the ones we love. They also give us comfort and warm feelings and help promote a happier lifestyle. They're fulling and fun to be around.
