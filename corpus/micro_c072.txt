Supermarkets should charge for plastic bags in order to encourage the use of reusable bags. The approximately one trillion plastic bags used annually across the world pose a serious threat to various animals and a long term environmental menace. Although alternatives like paper and cotton reusable bags potentially create a negative impact greater than plastic bags, a well-informed and properly motivated population can significantly reduce environmental hazards. Existing disposable plastic bags aren't going anywhere any time soon since it takes up to a 1000 years for one to breakdown. If a charge for plastic bags leads to even a small reduction in usage, the world will be better for it.
