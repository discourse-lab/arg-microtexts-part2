A larger family will create a better atmosphere for a child. They will be more outgoing, more playful, because of not being around just adults all the time. In my experience, being an only child you are more serious. On the negative, a larger family costs a whole lot more. In the long run, yes a larger family is better for children, because they will learn so much more.
