Recycling lessens the likelihood of wildlife death related to littering. People are more likely to recycle if there is monetary value involved. Also, if one state adopts a deposit on soft drink bottles and cans in order to promote recycling then all of the states should adopt this deposit. However, one would question if people will drive around wasting gas to get to the recycling center. The idea of saving wildlife and gaining money from the recycling products would be expected to outweigh the negative aspect of having to use gas actually recycle. ALL STATES SHOULD ADOPT A DEPOSIT ON SOFT DRING BOTTLES AND CANS IN ORDER TO PROMOTE RECYCLING.
