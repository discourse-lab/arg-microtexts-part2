Living in a city where pollution is an excessive problem is not a good idea. Even if good employment was secured, I would only be contributing to the pollution problem by adding myself and my family. One could argue that having a job that pays well would outweigh any negative impacts to the environment, and that supporting oneself and one's family is more important than protecting the environment. However, I believe it is everyone's responsibility to act in a way that protects our environment for our future generations.
