There is no solution to the nuclear waste problem. It takes thousands of years to dilute nuclear waste to a level considered safe. Managing nuclear waste poses a huge risk to people and the environment. The risk of contamination by far outweighs any economical advantage that creates nuclear waste. However, experts have in fact developed the necessary technologies, which mostly are being used today to ensure that the environment and the public are protected. If nuclear waste were to get in the wrong hands, (ex. terrorist) the results could be catastrophic. Thus, the risk involved handling nuclear waste responsibly is far to great for people and the planet.
