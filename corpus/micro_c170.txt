The primary job of a parent is to prepare the child to live independently on their own. A helicopter parent does not allow the child to develop life skills needed to do that. A child eventually grows up and parents eventually die. When a child grows up to adulthood from helicopter parents they face challenges that can make surviving the harsh realities of adulthood impossible. HELICOPTER PARENTS ARE BAD FOR THEIR CHILDREN.
