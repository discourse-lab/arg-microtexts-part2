Large families are not better for the children. Statistics show there is a larger ratio of teen pregnancies, school dropouts, and criminal convictions in families with more than 3 children. The main problem is the loss of parental focus and guidance for each child. One possible counter argument is that there is more long term bonding and support among the siblings. I would suggest that this is needed because of the proportionate lack of parental contact and guidance that occurs during childhood in big families.
