I think that, to some extent, romantic movies can leave an impression on viewers about what they think their real life relationships should be. Most people can tell the difference between reality and movies, but seeing perfect fictional relationships can give people false expectations. They may wish they had that in their real lives even though it was obviously written for entertainment purposes. YES, THE EXPECTATIONS RAISED BY ROMANTIC MOVIES ARE DAMAGING TO REAL RELATIONSHIPS.
