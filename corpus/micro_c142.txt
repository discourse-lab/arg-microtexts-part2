The government can regulate electric companies so that they have to incorporate more wind energy into their plans. By forcing them to use wind energy this will indeed speed it up. Also as more and more customers are offered it in their utility plans and thus, there will be an increase in demand for it which will speed it up also. There are those that say that government regulation always comes with too much red tape and inevitably slows progress. In the case of wind energy, even with red tape regulation can only speed up the spread. Without regulation companies will not use it.
