On one hand, yes I think removing rhinos' horns would be a good idea. If a rhino doesn't have it's horn, then there is no benefit for someone killing it other than to just be cruel. But at the same time, I think just going ahead and removing it's horns is kind of cruel. Don't they need them for survival? NO, THE HORN OF WILD RHINOS SHOULD NOT BE REMOVED TO PREVENT THEM FROM BEING POACHED.
