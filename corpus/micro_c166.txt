Teenagers that get pregnant are not ready to enter into such a commitment. They got to where they are now by being in the moment and not thinking about their future. Their ability to raise a child is questionable, and we cannot forget that they themselves are in many ways still children. While they can seek help from family for this, not everyone will have the same level of support. The teenager will have a much more difficult time getting ahead in life, and this will disproportionately affect the lower classes more than the upper. It is an unfair thing to do to someone. TEENAGERS THAT GET PREGNANT SHOULD NOT KEEP THEIR CHILDREN.
