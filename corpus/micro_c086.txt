Excessive use of video games damages children's ability to interact in real life situations. Not only do kids lose the ability to socialize face to face, but they also have the tendency to become addicted to these video games. Such addiction to video games can open the door to other, more damaging addictions, such as drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and pornography. Although they can be an interesting and captivating teaching tool when used in moderation, if video games are too heavily relied on in the classroom, it can ultimately be damaging to our society.
