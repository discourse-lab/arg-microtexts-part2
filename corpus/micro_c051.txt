Anyone who operating a vehicle should be strictly prohibited to use a cell phone in any capacity, unless its hands-free; which mean no phone calls, making or receiving, no texting, messaging, no surfing the web, viewing videos or photos and no playing games. Being distracting by one's cell phone can significantly increase the chances of getting into a major car accident, cause harm to the driver, their passengers and other motorists on the road. No matter who good a driver you might think you are, and you may feel that your paying attention well enough, but the truth of the matter is, driving needs the driver's full attention. Any caught driving while operating a cell phone should be punished with steep fines.
