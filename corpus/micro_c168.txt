Helicopter parents, in spite of their good intentions, often suffocate their children with too much attention. Kids need to have some freedom to have some of their time for themselves. If they aren't allowed the freedom to make some of their own decision, and mistakes, they have an unreasonable expectation that everything will always be laid out in a straight, structured line. However, the helicopter children do perform better in school and have an opportunity to do much more extracurricular activities. In summary, kids need to be able to be kids. HELICOPTER PARENTS ARE BAD FOR CHILDREN.
