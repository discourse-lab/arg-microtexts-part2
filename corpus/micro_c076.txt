Video games do cause people, especially impressionable teens, to act more violent. The gore, violence, and horror that they see in these games tends to reflect on their daily lives and makes them crave the excitement they get from the games. Now, the games don't necessarily make them kill more people, but they are more violent overall. When they compare the games and the excitement of the violence and gore to their real lives, it makes them crave that same level of intensity which makes them act out.
