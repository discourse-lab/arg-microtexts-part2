Composting can help the environment because composting reduces greenhouse gases. Composting also helps to replenish soil with critical minerals and nutrients that lead to better soil quality. Another benefit of composting is that it helps to keep food scraps out of landfills. There can be a downside with composting due to runoff as some composting materials contain heavy metals but enhanced filtration systems are minimizing the risk of this impact. Overall, composting has multiple benefits that will all contribute in aggregate toward helping our environment.
