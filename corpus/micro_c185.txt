Families participating in sports teams can be a good way to bond. When families are competing together and working together as a team they feel more connected and engaged with each other. It is also an excellent way to improve the family's total health. Sports also helps to teach families discipline. The risk of injury is a possible side effect from families doing sports together, but the positive benefits far outweigh any risks. DOING SPORTS TOGETHER IS A GOOD THING FOR FAMILIES.
