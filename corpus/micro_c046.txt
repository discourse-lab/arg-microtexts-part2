Car drivers should be prohibited from using cell phones because they tend to cause distraction. Holding the cell phone in the hand while driving and talking causes attention to be diverted off the roads and traffic. This causes further hindrance to safe driving as the driver ends up using just one hand instead of both hands on the steering wheel. Cell phone usage could be limited to blue tooth only as it can help drivers attend to urgent calls while keeping hands free from the phone and on the steering wheel at all times. Distraction due to cell phones is probably one of the leading causes in vehicle accidents.
