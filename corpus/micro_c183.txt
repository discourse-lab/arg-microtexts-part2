Spending time together as a family engaged in sports together is a good thing. It increases a sense of family togetherness, gets people outside and into the fresh air and sunshine, and gets the heart rate going. This in turn helps to keep weight at a healthy level, and increases longevity. One might argue that it's dangerous for some people to engage in strenuous activity. However, many sports can be ""toned down"" for novices or those who are just starting out, and with the permission of your doctor, sports are always a good thing.
