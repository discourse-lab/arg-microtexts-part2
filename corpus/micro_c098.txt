Some believe that with the coming of computers and digital books paper and traditionally printed books will soon become obsolete. This is very unlikely to happen as physical media offers many benefits not shared by it's digital counterpart. Things printed on paper can be viewed without any access to electricity. Many people also experience discomfort when reading from a computer display for long periods. Some say that digital storage is more secure than physical storage, but there are many security issues with files stored on computers that are not shared by physical files, such as the threat of hacking.
