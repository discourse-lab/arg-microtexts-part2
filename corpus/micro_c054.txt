I live in Michigan, where we have a deposit. I regularly see people bringing huge amounts of bottles and cans to grocery stores to recycle them. While I do not have exact statistics on the topic, this indicates to me that deposits promote recycling and should therefore be adopted. This has also become a source of income for homeless people. I see homeless people picking up littered cans so they can later recycle them for the deposit, which seems good to me.
