Schools should not use video games as a teaching tool. Videogames hurt the eyes of children and can be violent. They will view school time as entertainment and not as serious. They will not learn as much and will not succeed because of these video games. Some might say that video games will get the attention of these students, but I think that this opinion is a myth and is not based in fact.
