Landfills are bad for handling our trash because they cause a lot of pollution and run off. Landfills also produce a lot of odor and people have gotten sick from them as well. It also takes up a ton of space and acreage. However, apparently the thought that we are running out of landfill space is not true. That being said, they still are not the best way of handling our trash.
