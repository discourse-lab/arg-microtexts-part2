Have cell phones and social media made families closer? We would like to think that these modern inventions have accomplished the opposite, however, it seems as though families are closer nowadays. They stay in touch with each other throughout the day and for those that live far apart, social media and unlimited cell phone plans have made it possible to have daily contact rather than waiting for special occasions. Long distance rates no longer apply like they did when I was a child. I can talk to my cousins whenever I like. I have to admit though, that having the ability to communicate so freely does not mean that we do it.
