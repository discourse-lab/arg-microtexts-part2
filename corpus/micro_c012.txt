The horns of wild rhinos should not be removed to prevent them from being poached. Removing the rhino horns is the crime, not just removing the rhino's horns for money. When you mutilate an animal, you are the problem. Saying that you are mutilating the animal to protect people from mutilation poaching is absurd because either way the rhino is mutilated. It's an attack on the animal. It doesn't help conservation, it just tries to take out the monetary component of the slaughter. Bad way to go.
