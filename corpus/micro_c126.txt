There is not a way to handle nuclear waste responsibly. Humans are prone to error. No system is perfect. Eventually there will be a leak or some other disastrous scenario and we won't be able to undo it. It could be handled ""responsibly"" for a time, possibly even a long time, but eventually human error will occur.
