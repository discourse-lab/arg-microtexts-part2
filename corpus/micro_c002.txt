In some cases, hunting can remove threats to the environment. Texas, in particular, has an overabundance of wild/feral boars that destroy farmers' fields, and root up other ground, too. Furthermore, hunting your own meat saves up the natural resources that would otherwise be used in a processing plant. HUNTING IS GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.
