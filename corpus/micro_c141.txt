Government can pass regulations to make wind energy more inviting to investors and businesses, but only that private investment will really speed up the spread of wind energy. Energy companies in the U.S. are privately owned and make their choices based on what is economically feasible. Wind energy is only viable in places with the necessary wind on a steady basis. Favorable tax and investment policies by government may enhance opportunities, but the government cannot force investment and cannot bring wind to places that lack it in the air speed and quality needed. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS WILL NOT NECESSARILY SPEED UP THE SPREAD OF WIND ENERGY.
