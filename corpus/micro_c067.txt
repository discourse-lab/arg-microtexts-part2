The problem with plastic bags is they are not biodegradable and they pollute the environment. In order to encourage the use for reusable bags it would be ideal to charge for the plastic bags to provide an incentive for using them. There are those who would say that not everyone can afford reusable bags but that is not a valid argument because the plastic bags will still be available for only a few pennies.
