Social media has improved the lives of teenagers. As an umbrella term, its impact can be nebulous, but the simple fact remains that young people today can find it easier to find like-minded others and new friends who share even uncommon interests. They can reach out for support or camaraderie at pretty much any time rather than being limited to time spent physically with others their own age. They can share what matters to them and feel validation that adolescents in the past may have been unable to find. Though many point out the dangers of online bullying or even adult predators, the overarching truth is that social media afford teenagers the opportunity for meaningful interaction impossible before its advent.
