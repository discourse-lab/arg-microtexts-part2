Video games are increasingly popular in our everyday life. They can have a negative impact on lives and children, though. They create less time together and more time involved in solving the puzzle or task assigned to them. There are many which promote violent acts to solve missions, and the chat rooms available open our children to pedophiles and kidnappers posing as children their age. Some have claimed that playing games with their children has helped to increase togetherness and unity, but not a lot of deep, personal conversations can be had while you are fighting each other to the death in a role-playing game. Use of video games are hazardous to successful, happy families.
