Video games do impact family life, but that impact does not always have to be negative. There are many games available that are suitable for all ages, and playing those as a family can bring the family together. Family video games would be the modern day equivalent to gathering as a family to play a board game, and there has never been controversy around that activity. The problem that exists is potentially in violent video games, but with good parenting, those can be avoided in favor of more wholesome, family-friendly games.
