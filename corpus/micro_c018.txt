We live in the age of technology but the constant use of cell phones is definitely not bringing families closer together. Family time used to be about spending quality time and actually talking to each other. Now, it's time that is largely spent staring at screens while occupying the same space. This is driving a wedge between families and it needs to be rectified. Family time needs to be a time where cell phones are put away and interaction with each other has everyone's full attention. If this doesn't change we could find that families become even more dysfunctional as a unit. Though, there has been no scientific research to date that can confirm this outcome.
